# Genie Architecture

## Core Components

### Wallet Module
The wallet module serves as an interface for blockchain interactions with the following characteristics:
- Handles transaction signing, message signing, and typed data signing
- Exposes only public addresses for security
- Private keys are managed through constructor injection
- Provides a standardized interface for different blockchain wallets

### Network Module
The network module manages blockchain connectivity and configuration:
- Handles network setup and connection management
- Supports multiple blockchain protocols
- Manages network-specific configurations
- Provides unified API for cross-chain interactions

### Agent System
The agent system is the core orchestrator that coordinates between components:

#### Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**
   - Loads configuration files
   - Sets up plugins
   - Initializes network connections
   - Configures wallet interfaces
   - Establishes environment variables
   - Creates agent graph topology
   - Initializes agent state management

2. **Runtime**
   - Manages active connections
   - Coordinates plugin interactions
   - Handles transaction orchestration
   - Monitors system state
   - Orchestrates multi-agent workflows
   - Manages agent message passing
   - Handles state transitions

### Multi-Agent Architecture
The system supports distributed agent networks using LangGraph:

#### Agent Graph
- Defines agent relationships and communication paths
- Supports both sequential and parallel agent execution
- Enables dynamic routing based on task requirements
- Maintains shared state across agent network

#### Agent Communication
- Asynchronous message passing between agents
- Structured message formats for inter-agent communication
- State management for complex workflows
- Event-driven coordination patterns

#### Workflow Management
- Graph-based task orchestration
- Conditional branching based on agent outputs
- Rollback and error recovery mechanisms
- Progress tracking and monitoring

## Plugin Architecture

### Plugin Integration
- All plugins receive an agent instance for system interaction
- Plugins must implement standard interfaces
- Access to core functionalities through agent APIs
- Supports hot-pluggable architecture

### Security Considerations
- Sandboxed plugin execution
- Permission-based access control
- Secure plugin communication channels
